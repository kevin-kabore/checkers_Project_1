# Checkers
==========

This is a checkers game I'm making for my first project at General Assembly in the Web Development Immersive course.
I will be using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the jQuery library to build my project. I will also be using Trello to keep track of my changes and features for my MVP.

MVP includes:

- Game Board & Pieces
- Pieces move successfully
- Turns alternate
- Cannot make falso moves
- Win logic works & is consistent with checkers game win logic
